## About Me

Hi! I'm a Masters in Computer Science student at UC San Diego specializing in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Specifically, my interests are in NLP and speech. I currently work with Prof. Jingbo Shang on document image understanding. Specifically, on improving few-shot entity recognition with multimodal language models and graph neural networks. In the summer of 2022, I was a Data Scientist Intern at Apple in the Ad Platforms Data Insights team where I worked on time series clustering models for budget utilization analysis. Before I joined UCSD, I worked at LEAP Lab, IISc with Prof. Sriram Ganapathy on speaker verification and diagnostics of COVID-19 using speech and respiratory sounds (Project Coswara).

## Misc.

Besides this, I'm a huge sports buff and love music. Always open to any conversations on cricket, football, tennis and F1! During the pandemic, I finally got around uploading some song covers on YouTube. I also enjoy running and hiking. Doing a full marathon is in my bucket list!
